# Car-Insurance-Claims-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
Project 3 - Car Insurance Claim Prediction Project
Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification

We'll train a machine learning model to predict whether the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not.

*About Dataset*: The Dataset is taken from a Kaggle. It contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.
